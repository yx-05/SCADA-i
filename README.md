## üìù Project Description

**SCADA-i** is an **IoT-based SCADA-BMS system** enhanced with **predictive AI** for smarter building maintenance. The **hardware setup** integrates multiple **ESP32 microcontrollers**, including an **ESP32-CAM** running a **YOLO object detection CV model** for **accurate occupancy detection**. Supporting sensors include **multiple ultrasonic modules** for **seat-hogging prevention and monitoring**, and a **DHT11 sensor** for **real-time temperature and humidity measurement**. Data from all sensors is transmitted via an **MQTT broker over Wi-Fi** to a **backend system**, whereby **three distinctive ML predictive models** will estimate **occupancy trends**, **time-to-cool timings**, and **optimal thermal comfort levels**. The **embedded system** will monitor **environmental and usage conditions**; thus through such monitoring, enable **automated control actions** for **HVAC**, **lighting**, and **power systems** in its designated room. By combining the **reliability of traditional SCADA-BMS systems** with **CV** and **AI-driven predictions**, our system provides a **robust, scalable, and intelligent solution** for **next-generation smart buildings**.

Our mission:  
> *Create a more sustainable, energy-efficient, and comfortable campus environment for students, faculty, and staff ‚Äî powered by intelligence, not intuition.*

## ‚ú® Key Features

**Real-time HVAC Optimization**  
AI models dynamically adjust temperature, airflow, and humidity based on occupancy, weather, and historical patterns.

**Live Occupancy Monitoring**  
Computer vision and sensor fusion provide accurate, real-time room usage data ‚Äî accessible via dashboard or mobile app.

**Predictive Pre-Cooling**  
Machine learning predicts future occupancy and triggers pre-cooling cycles to ensure comfort while minimizing energy waste.

**MQTT-Based Hardware Interface**  
Lightweight, low-latency communication with physical HVAC controllers and environmental sensors via MQTT protocol.

**Seamless IoT Device Integration**  
Plug-and-play support for heterogeneous sensors and actuators ‚Äî including ESP32, DHT11, ultrasonic modules, relays, and smart switches ‚Äî enabling flexible, scalable deployment across diverse building environments.
